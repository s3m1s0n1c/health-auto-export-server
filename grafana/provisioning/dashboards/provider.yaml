# This dashboard provisioning file tells Grafana to automatically load any
# dashboards found in `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards`. We mount the host's
# `dashboard-examples` directory into this path via dockerâ€‘compose. The
# `folder` setting organizes the dashboards under a named folder in the
# Grafana UI. The update interval defines how often Grafana will scan the
# directory for changes.
